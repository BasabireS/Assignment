	/* 	USABILITY TESTING SUGGESTIONS
	 
	 * UI ASTHETICS
	 		 Website has moderate asthetic features from my point of view.
	 		 Good things about Asthetics are
	 		   -All fields are clearly visible
	 		   -All headings are clear and self explanatory
	 		   -It has consize content
	 		 Things that can be improved according to me are
	 		   -Headings could be kept simple(non Italic)
	 		   -Background color could be of more decent/light green color
	 		   -Size of some rows is unnecessarily kept large it can be scaled down
	 		   -Under power supply heading one row at the top is kept blank it can be removed for better space utilization
	 		   -Overall Space utility could be better
	 		
	 * UASABILITY
	 		The overall usability is good 	
	 		   -Order of options appearing on web page can be changed eg., Purpose of supply can mentioned on the top
	 		    so that next options should appear according to that
	 		   -We can also improve particular headings appearance after completing previous headings information so that 
	 		    we can start filling form if it has been interrupted previously 
	 		   -As we can see when we click on list of documents it direct us to another page rather than that we can provide that info 
	 		    at the starting of form so that it can be easy for customer to fill form
	 		    
	 * Functionality
	        Overall Functionality is also good
	        	-The declaration of customer is mentioned 2 times it should be converted into one proper declaration
	        	-We can also add Email validation functionality
	        	-Total load functionality is very good that helps in understanding actual load(Calculate load)
